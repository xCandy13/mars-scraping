# mars-scraping

part_1_mars_news.ipynb contains the code to scrape the titles and preview text for articles appearing the the Mars News site. It stores them in a list of dictionaries.

part_2_mars_weather.ipynb contains the code to scrape weather data from the Mars Temperature Data site. It parses that data and organizes them into a dataframe. Analysis of the data to find number of months, Martian days' worth of data, warmest and coldest months, average highest and lowest pressure months, and estimated terrestrial days in a Martian year takes place in this Jupyter notebook. It also exports the scraped data to the 'mars_weather.csv' file.
